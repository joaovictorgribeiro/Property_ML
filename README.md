**REAL ESTATE DATASET ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING MODEL**

**OVERVIEW**

This repository contains a dataset comprising real estate data from a region in the United States. The dataset includes variables such as price, number of bedrooms, area in square meters, address, number of bathrooms, etc.

**DATASET**

The dataset provides insights into various aspects of the real estate market in the specified region. It serves as a valuable resource for analyzing trends and patterns in property prices and features.

**ANALYSIS**

A basic statistical analysis has been conducted on the dataset to gain insights into the distribution, correlation, and summary statistics of the variables. This analysis helps in understanding the characteristics of the real estate market in the region.

**MACHINE LEARNING MODEL**

Additionally, a preliminary machine learning model has been developed to predict the value of a property based on user-selected features. The model utilizes the variables mentioned earlier to make predictions about the price of a property. This model aims to assist users in estimating the value of a desired property based on their preferences.

**HOW TO USE**

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Explore the dataset to understand the available variables and their distributions.

Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (eg. Google Colab) or Python script to delve into the statistical analysis.

Utilize the machine learning model to predict property values based on user-defined features.

**CONTRIBUTIONS**
